                        There is an interesting legend in the Skanda Purana about the manner in which the Goddess Chandi acquired the epithet of Harsiddhi. Once when Shiva and Parvati were alone on Mount Kailash, two demons Chand and Prachand tried to force their way in.
                        Shiva called upon Chandi to destroy them which she did.
